# Study of ads for the sale of apartments

*We have at our disposal the data of the Yandex.Realty service - an archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. You need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. Our task is to set the parameters. This will allow you to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.*

*Two types of data are available for each apartment for sale. The first ones are entered by the user, the second ones are obtained automatically on the basis of cartographic data. For example, the distance to the city center, airport, nearest park and body of water.*
